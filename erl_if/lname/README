at the beginig
cd /path/to/cnode_and_erlfiles/

for compile put this command

make

start cnode on whatever free potr
you shoul check it by netstat for example
here I have started it on 34561
./cnode 34561 
inet addr -> 127.0.0.1
initialize...
node
socket
publish
accept

this output has appeared

-----
Note. I had started this example localy, bouth nodes were on the same host.
And binaries were in the same directory too.
-----
then start the erlnag node
$ erl -name enode@127.0.0.1 -setcookie cookie
>net_kernel:hidden_connect_node('cnode@127.0.0.1').
true
(enode@127.0.0.1)2> veil:foo(5).
veil:foo(5)
25
(enode@127.0.0.1)3> veil:bar(5).
veil:bar(5)
10

works! :)
